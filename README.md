ChessPart2.ipynb is human and AI based game.

chess_game_with_Monte_Carlo.ipynb is completely AI based. both of the players are AI there.

Chess960_AI_or_human_option.ipynb is implementation of chess960 with an option whether the user wants to play or the AI should play alone.


Proper attribution and link to any existing code used in project:

We are planning to implement this chess960 version in our code: https://github.com/aStieber/Chess960/blob/master/README.md instead of using the library

For monte carlo implementation, we took help from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-monte-carlo-tree-search-mcts/

For stockfish and evaluation implementation: https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/engine.html

To use the pychess library : https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Installation :
We used python code. To run the code we need to install the dependencies: 
Write "pip install chess" in command prompt to install the chess library



Explanation of how to run the computer experiments:

The board is randomized as per chess960 rules, it can also be customized based on the programmer's choice using the command:
chess.Board("all the positions that you want")
There will be 16 pieces for each players. There will be 8 pawns, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 1 queen, and 1 king.
White side will have first letters of all the pieces with small letter (p,b,k,r,q,k) and human will have all the pieces with capital letter (P,B,K,R,Q,K).

The game is Ai and human based. You will be asked with options what you want.

If you choose AI vs human, After you run the code, AI will give the first move and you will be the second player. 
human needs to give two input each time. First one is where they want their piece to go and second one is the row and colum of which piece they want to move. here row is from a to h and colum is from 1 to 8.
If you choose invalid move, game will be over that time.
You will get the row and colum idea from the following image:
